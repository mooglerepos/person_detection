Hello 
I have managed to run the program in local using flask.
I have given all the files is this github repository.
Sir, you should have opencv, imutils, flask, vagera.
Then just run the command "python app.py"

First the program will find the camera and if camera is of(False)then it will play the given video file.

I have already given the file named "768x576.avi".
